## I. Description

This article will introduce the chains we currently support and related information. You can use the following addresses and links to quickly find the information you need to know, so that you can better develop and use Crust in the EVM ecosystem.

## II. What is Crust?

Crust provides a decentralized storage network of Web3 ecosystem. It supports multiple storage layer protocols such as IPFS, and exposes storage interfaces to application layer. Crust's technical stack is also capable of supporting a decentralized computing layer. It is designed to build a decentralized cloud ecosystem that values data privacy and ownership.
